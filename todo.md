- iEnS
- EnOpt
- Improve writing
- Localisation (distance-based, automatic), smaller N
- Inflation
- Schemes to deal with full R.
- Schemes to deal with model error.
- Better case
    - More realistic parameter values
    - Different geostat fields
    - Better model (compressible)
    - Different / more unknowns
        - saturation0 w/ sigmoid
        - porosity
        - ...?
    - Pressure data
    - 3D
    - Faults, channels, aquifers?
    - Different (random?) well configs
- Correlation/sensitivity plot with sliders
- Game: try to beat EnOpt when
    - truth is unknown
    - average over truths
