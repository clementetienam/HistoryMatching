We term the parameterized permeability fields \"pre-permeability\". *If* we use the exponential, then we will we working with log-permeabilities. At any rate, the transform should be chosen so that the parameterized permeabilities are suited for ensemble methods, i.e. are distributed as a Gaussian.  But this consideration must be weighted against the fact that that nonlinearity (which is also a difficulty for ensemble methods) in the transform might add to the nonlinearity of the total/composite forward model.  In any case, since this is a synthetic case, we can freely choose *both* the distribution of the parameterized permeabilities, *and* the transform.  Here we use Gaussian fields, and a \"perturbed\" exponential function (to render the problem a little more complex)."

This may come as a surprise, because the EnKS processes the observations sequentially, like the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), not in the batch manner of the ES. Because sequential processing is more gradual, one would expect it to achieve better accuracy than batch approaches. However, the ES is preferred because the uncertainty in the state fields is often of less importance than the uncertainty in the parameter fields. More imperatively, (re)starting the simulators (e.g. ECLIPSE) from updated state fields (as well as parameter fields) is a troublesome affair; the fields may have become \"unphysical\" (or \"not realisable\") because of the ensemble update, which may hinder the simulator from producing meaningful output (it may crash, or have trouble converging). On the other hand, by going back to the parameter fields before geological modelling (using fast model update (FMU)) tends to yield more realistic parameter fields.

    "In terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE), the ES is expected to improve on the prior. The \"expectation\" wording indicates that this is true on average, but not always. To be specific, it means that it is guaranteed to hold true if the RMSE is calculated for infinitely many experiments (each time simulating a new synthetic truth and observations from the prior). The reason for this is that the ES uses the Kalman update, which is the BLUE (best linear unbiased estimate), and \"best\" means that the variance must get reduced. However, note that this requires the ensemble to be infinitely big, which it most certainly is not in our case. Therefore, we do not need to be very unlucky to observe that the RMSE has actually increased. Despite this, as we will see later, the data match might yield a different conclusions concerning the utility of the update."
