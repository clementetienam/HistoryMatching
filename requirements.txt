# In general, these deps should be pinned to the version provided by Colab,
# so that we get the same environment locally.
# In particular, numpy/scipy/matplotlib... are already imported when opening Colab,
# and so cannot be down/upgraded without restarting the kernel
# (which is quite doable, especially since Colab restarts automatically
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/60237923 , but still cumbersome).
# However, on MacOS I need a different mpl version (see below),
# so that dependency must go in here.

p_tqdm~=1.3

# Already in Colab
jupyter~=1.0.0
jupytext~=1.11.3
scipy~=1.7

# For jupyterlab
jupyterlab~=3.2.3
ipympl~=0.8.2

# On newer MacOS, need mpl>=3.3 coz of https://bugs.python.org/issue33725 .
#   I tried (with no luck) the other workarounds from here
#   github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15410#issuecomment-632283639
#   namely using python>=3.8 or `mp.set_start_method('forkserver')`.
# !=3.6.0 because https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/23921
matplotlib~=3.3, !=3.6.0
