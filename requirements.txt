# Apps (unlike libs/packages) should use pinned requirements,
# for exact reproducibility, generated by pip freeze.
# One also typically maintains (also in VCS) a list of direct/top-level
# and abstract (unpinned) dependencies to be able to easily
# refresh the requirements, and update the direct dependencies.
# However
# - Colab seems to have special needs (e.g. mpl 3.4 does not work)
#   which easily conflict with the (detailed) output of `pip freeze`.
#   Also, installing the output of `pip freeze` on Colab takes
#   much longer than installing a list of abstract deps.
# - Doing pip install -r requirements-dev.txt will change the
#   output of pip freeze, ruining reproducibility.
#   On the other hand, we don't want to list the dev tools
#   among the core requirements, especially since they are quite
#   likely to conflict with Colab's special needs.
#   The tool pip-tools might fix this, but seems pretty complicated
#   (uses requirements.in (or setup.py) to produce requirements.txt,
#   but suggests using one requirements file for each python env and OS)
#   Also, we don't want to use poetry/pipenv in this case.
# As a moderately reasonable fix, we manually pin the top-level dependencies.
