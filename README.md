This repository holds the Jupyter turorials on history matching.
It is a placeholder repository, because the tutorial will later be integrated into
https://github.com/nansencenter/DA-tutorials


1. **Prerequisite**: Python 3.8.  
   If you're not a python expert:  
   1a. Install Python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).  
   1b. Use the [Anaconda terminal](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda) to run the commands below.  
   1c. (Optional) [Create & activate a new Python environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments).  
   If the installation (below) fails, try doing step 1c first.

2. **Install**:  
   Run these commands in the terminal (excluding the `$` sign):  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/patricknraanes/HistoryMatching.git`  
   `$ pip install -r DA-tutorials/requirements.txt`  

3. **Launch the Jupyter notebooks**:  
   `$ jupyter-notebook`  
   This will open up a page in your web browser that is a file navigator.  
   Click on a `Demo.ipynb`.
